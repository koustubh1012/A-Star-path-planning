# ENPM 661: Planning for Robotics
## PROJECT 3 - PHASE 1

### Authors:
- Keyur Borad (kborad@umd.edu)
- Aryan Mishra (amishr17@umd.edu)
- FNU Koustubh (koustubh@umd.edu)

### Instructions to Run the Code:
1. Download the package and navigate to your directory.
    ```
    cd YOUR_DIRECTORY
    ```
2. Run the code:
    ```
    python a_star_FNU_aryan_keyur.py
    ```
3. Enter the clearance, radius of the robot, the start position and orientation and goal position and orientation. Finally Enter the step size

4. We have used the following attributes for the sample video:
    ```
    Enter the clearance from the obstacle in pixel: 10
    Enter the radius of the robot in pixel: 10
    Enter the start x coordinate: 30
    Enter the start y coordinate: 50
    Enter the initial heading: 0
    Enter the goal x coordinate: 900
    Enter the goal y coordinate: 250
    Enter the goal heading: 60
    Enter step size: 5
    ```
4. After completion, open your folder. There would be a simulation video titled `output.mp4`.
